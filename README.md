# Pokemon-List-Generator

This is a Pokemon List Generator made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

JavaScript part of the project includes taking names of the 151 pokemon and storing them in a array. Then a GitHub-URL is used for generating the pokemon image. The substring of the URL is stored in a variable and for-loop is used to loop through the 151 pokemon. The image and name is then added into a div upon generation.
